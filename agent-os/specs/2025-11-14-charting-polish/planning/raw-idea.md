# Raw Idea: Charting Polish

## Feature Description

Charting polish for the calendar view charts in @weather-app/apps/web/. The current scale is fixed at the edges (max at top, min at bottom). We need to:
- Add 5 degrees of padding top and bottom
- Set a minimum range (max to min of 20 degrees)
- Apply this to both historical and future graphs
- Add titles to both components
